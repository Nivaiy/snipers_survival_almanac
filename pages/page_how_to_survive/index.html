                <h1>How to survive in the game Snipers Survival?</h1>
                <p>On the first day, the most important thing is to build a shelter, using anything—dirt, sticks, or whatever you can find. The key is to use your time wisely and not waste it. There are 2 cans of food in your backpack; they should be enough for building and digging.</p>
                <p>The first main enemy on the first night in the game is a wolf. It emerges at night from its den, which looks like a mound of dark, buried earth, and it is quite dangerous. It runs fast, bites quickly, and there can be up to 8 of these wolves at once. It hunts not only the player but also rabbits, so if you need rabbits, it’s best to keep them safe, as they can also be used as a food source if cooked in a kettle with an empty can.</p>

                <p>But don’t worry — there are only a few wolves in the first location, about four, so always keep your sniper rifle ready to defend yourself.</p>
